# ðŸ’« About Me:
I live inside my own world of make-believe<br>Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities<br>I see the world through eyes covered in ink and bleach<br>Cross out the ones who heard my cries and watched me weep<br>I love everything<br>Fire's spreading all around my room<br>My world's so bright<br>It's hard to breathe but that's alright<br><br>Hush<br><br>Shh<br><br>Tape my eyes open to force reality (oh, no no)<br>Why can't you just let me eat my weight in glee<br>I live inside my own world of make-believe<br>Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities<br>Some days I feel skinnier than all the other days<br>Sometimes I can't tell if my body belongs to me<br>I love everything<br>Fire's spreading all around my room<br>My world's so bright<br>It's hard to breathe but that's alright<br><br>Hush<br><br>Shh
